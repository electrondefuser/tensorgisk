# Tensorgisk: MagiskHide Package Detection (via Tensorflow)
Tensorgisk is a machine learning project that leverages TensorFlow to detect whether installed packages 
on an Android device match MagiskHide signatures. MagiskHide is a feature within Magisk that allows 
users to conceal root status from applications by selectively masking root access 
and preventing detection of system modifications.

# Features
- MagiskHide Detection: Utilizes a TensorFlow model to analyze installed packages and identify MagiskHide signatures.
- Comprehensive Analysis: Scans all installed packages on the device to ensure thorough detection.
- Poetry-Based Dependency Management: Uses Poetry for managing dependencies and virtual environments.
